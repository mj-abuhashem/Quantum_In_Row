# Introduction
Quantum In Row is a game in which the players choose a color and then
take turns dropping colored tokens into a six-row, seven-column.
When the players enjoy Quantum move’s “50% probability of appearing
chosen color in the same spot and in onther spot and the same for the other player”
.
The game become more interesting when they were collapsed.<br>

# Rules
2 Players.  <br>
1 quantum Colors (blue)  <br>
Wins 4 same dark color in a row, in column, or in diagonal.  <br>
the added feature let you enter two superpositions that has 50% probability of appearing in either of the two colors and the same for the component   <br>
1 classical play for each player then 2 quantum play for each player  <br>
this is conisedered a round every round there will be measurment (collapse)  <br>

as you can see in this pictures all the blue colors is quantum move and all has 50% chance of appearing after collapse in each color and the green did not have advantages of the winning
