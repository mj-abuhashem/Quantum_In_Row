#introduction
Quantum In Row is a game in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a six-row, seven-column. 
When the players enjoy Quantum move’s “50% probability of appearing chosen color in the same spot or in anther spot when it collapsed”.
The game become more interesting when they were collapsed.
